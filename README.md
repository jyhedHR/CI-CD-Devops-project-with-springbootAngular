# DevOps CI/CD Project with Nexus, JUnit, Mockito, SonarQube, and Webhooks

## 🛠️ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps CI/CD pipeline integrating artifact management, automated testing, code quality analysis, and continuous deployment. The goal is to automate the software delivery lifecycle using industry-standard tools and best practices.

## 🧩 Key Components

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automates building, testing, code analysis, and deployment.
- **Nexus Repository Manager**: Stores and manages build artifacts.
- **JUnit & Mockito**: Used for unit testing and mocking dependencies.
- **SonarQube**: Analyzes code quality, detects bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.
- **Webhooks**: Automates communication between tools (e.g., GitHub and Jenkins).

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools Used

| Tool/Technology | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| **Jenkins**     | CI/CD pipeline orchestration |
| **Nexus**       | Artifact storage and management |
| **JUnit**       | Unit testing framework |
| **Mockito**     | Java mocking framework |
| **SonarQube**   | Code quality analysis |
| **GitHub Webhooks** | Triggers Jenkins build on code push |
| **Maven/Gradle**| Build automation |

---

## 🚀 Pipeline Workflow

1. **Code Commit**: Developer pushes code to GitHub repository.
2. **Webhook Trigger**: GitHub webhook notifies Jenkins of the new push.
3. **Build Stage**: Jenkins pulls the code and compiles it using Maven/Gradle.
4. **Test Stage**: JUnit and Mockito run unit tests; results are archived.
5. **SonarQube Analysis**: Jenkins sends code to SonarQube for static analysis.
6. **Artifact Upload**: Upon success, Jenkins uploads `.jar`/`.war` to Nexus.
7. **Deployment (optional)**: Application is deployed to a staging/production server.

## ✅ Testing Strategy

- **JUnit** is used for writing and running unit tests.
- **Mockito** is integrated to simulate dependencies and test in isolation.
- Coverage reports are sent to SonarQube for deeper analysis.

---

## 📦 Artifact Management

- **Nexus** acts as a private repository to store versioned builds.
- Jenkins uploads generated artifacts after successful builds.

---

## 🔐 Code Quality with SonarQube

- Tracks bugs, code smells, vulnerabilities, and test coverage.
- Integrated directly into the Jenkins pipeline.
- Quality gates can be enforced to block bad builds.

---

## 🔄 Webhooks Integration

- GitHub webhook automatically triggers Jenkins on each push to the main branch.
- Ensures that the CI/CD pipeline runs continuously without manual intervention.

---

## 🧪 Example Technologies Stack

- **Language**: Java
- **Build Tool**: Maven or Gradle
- **Framework**: Spring Boot (optional)
- **CI Server**: Jenkins
- **Testing**: JUnit 5, Mockito
- **Artifact Repository**: Nexus 3.x
- **Quality Analysis**: SonarQube 9.x+
